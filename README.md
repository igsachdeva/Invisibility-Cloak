This project involves computer vision and is suitable for beginners. It is implemented using Python with the OpenCV library.

Key Concepts Utilized:

Image thresholding
Image masking
Color space conversion
Video input
System Requirements: Python 3, OpenCV, and Numpy should be installed on your system.

Instructions for Project Usage:

Ensure that your computer is stable and there are no objects obstructing the camera's view.
Run the provided Python script.
Two windows will appear: The first window will display the Hue, Saturation, and Value (HSV) values of the color of the sheet, while the second window will show the output.
Adjust the HSV values to match the color range of the sheet you are using.
